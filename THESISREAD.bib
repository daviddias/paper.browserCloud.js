@article{Ranjan2006,
abstract = {Efcient Resource discovery mechanism is one of the fundamental requirement for Grid computing systems, as it aids in resource management and scheduling of applications. Resource discovery activity involve searching for the appropriate resource types that match the user's application requirements. Various kinds of solutions to grid resource discovery have been suggested, including the centralised and hierarchical information server approach. However, both of these approaches have serious limitations in regards to scalability, fault-tolerance and network congestion. To overcome these limitations, indexing resource information using a decentralised (such as Peer-to-Peer (P2P)) network model has been actively proposed in the past few years. This article investigates various decentralised resource discovery techniques primarily driven by P2P network model. To summarise, this article presents a: (i) summary of current state of art in grid resource discovery; (ii) resource taxonomy with focus on computational grid paradigm; (iii) P2P taxonomy with focus on extending the current structured systems (such as Distributed Hash Tables) for indexing d-dimensional grid resource queries; (iv) detailed survey of existing works that can support d-dimensional grid resource queries; and (v) classication of the surveyed approaches based on the proposed P2P taxonomy. We believe that this taxonomy and its mapping to relevant systems would be useful for academic and industry based researchers who are engaged in the design of scalable Grid and P2P systems.},

abstract = {Large-scale peer-to-peer systems face security threats from faulty or hostile remote computing elements. To resist these threats, many such systems employ redundancy. However, if a single faulty entity can present multiple identities, it can control a substantial fraction of the system, thereby undermining this redundancy. One approach to preventing these “Sybil attacks” is to have a trusted agency certify identities. This paper shows that, without a logically centralized authority, Sybil attacks are always possible except under extreme and unrealistic assumptions of resource parity and coordination among entities.},

Freenet operates as a network of identical nodes that collectively pool their storage space to store data files and cooperate to route requests to the most likely physical location of data. No broadcast search or centralized location index is employed. Files are referred to in a location-independent manner, and are dynamically replicated in locations near requestors and deleted from locations where there is no interest. It is infeasible to discover the true origin or destination of a file passing through the network, and dificult for a node operator to determine or be held responsible for the actual physical contents of her own node.},

@phdthesis{Afify,
abstract = {It is no doubt that online social networks are currently the hottest trend in the web. During the last two years many web applications emerged to provide with their own system. However, a lack of innovation and a erce concurrence have slowed the trend, and many services were left without other choice than to close down. Much like what happened with the business of Search Engines and the Google's merciless dominance, Facebook and Myspace are growing very fast. The centralized access and data control is a serious privacy problem, and a solution is to provide with a pure peer-to-peer infrastructure so that users get the control over their data. Many research questions on how to implement a functional Peer-to-peer Social Network (P2PSN) are raised in the elds of storage and security. In this thesis we concentrate on access control as it is one of the most challenging feature of centralized servers to distribute among an untrusted network of peers.},

abstract = {This paper presents the design and evaluation of Pastry, a scalable, distributed object location and routing substrate for wide-area peer-to-peer applications. Pastry performs application-level routing and object location in a potentially very large overlay network of nodes connected via the Internet. It can be used to support a variety of peer-to-peer applications, including global data storage, data sharing, group communication and naming. Each node in the Pastry network has a unique identifier (nodeId). When presented with a message and a key, a Pastry node efficiently routes the message to the node with a nodeId that is numerically closest to the key, among all currently live Pastry nodes. Each Pastry node keeps track of its immediate neighbors in the nodeId space, and notifies applications of new node arrivals, node failures and recoveries. Pastry takes into account network locality; it seeks to minimize the distance messages travel, according to a to scalar proximity metric like the number of IP routing hops Pastry is completely decentralized, scalable, and self-organizing; it automatically adapts to the arrival, departure and failure of nodes. Experimental results obtained with a prototype implementation on an emulated network of up to 100,000 nodes confirm Pastry’s scalability and efficiency, its ability to self-organize and adapt to node failures, and its good network locality properties},

abstract = {Distributed hash tables have recently become a useful building block for a variety of distributed applications. However, current schemes based upon consistent hashing require both considerable implementation complexity and substantial storage overhead to achieve desired load balancing goals. We argue in this paper that these goals can be achieved more simply and more cost-effectively. First, we suggest the direct application of the “power of two choices” paradigm, whereby an item is stored at the less loaded of two (or more) random alternatives. We then consider how associating a small constant number of hash values with a key can naturally be extended to support other load balancing strategies, including load-stealing or load-shedding, as well as providing natural fault-tolerance mechanisms.},

abstract = {We present Emscripten, a compiler from LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine) assembly to JavaScript. This opens up two avenues for running code written in languages other than JavaScript on the web: (1) Compile code directly into LLVMassembly, and then compile that into JavaScript using Emscripten, or (2) Compile a language’s entire runtime into LLVMand then JavaScript, as in the previous approach, and then use the compiled runtime to run code written in that language. For example, the former approach can work for C and C++, while the latter can work for Python; all three examples open up new opportunities for running code on the web. Emscripten itself is written in JavaScript and is avail- able under the MIT license (a permissive open source li- cense), at http://www.emscripten.org. As a compiler from LLVM to JavaScript, the challenges in designing Em- scripten are somewhat the reverse of the norm – one must go from a low-level assembly into a high-level language, and recreate parts of the original high-level structure of the code that were lost in the compilation to low-level LLVM. We detail the methods used in Emscripten to deal with those challenges, and in particular present and prove the validity of Emscripten’s Relooper algorithm, which recreates high- level loop structures from low-level branching data},

abstract = {Reliable communication on the Internet is guaranteed by a standard set of protocols, used by all computers. Here we show that these protocols can be exploited to compute with the communication infrastructure, transforming the Internet into a distributed computer in which servers unwittingly perform computation on behalf of a remote node. In this model, which we call 'parasitic computing', one machine forces target computers to solve a piece of a complex computational problem merely by engaging them in standard communication. Consequently, the target computers are unaware that they have performed computation for the benefit of a commanding node. As experimental evidence of the principle of parasitic computing, we harness the power of several web servers across the globe, which-unknown to them-work together to solve an NP complete problem.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, we have seen a revolution in con- nectivity between computers, and a resulting paradigm shift from centralized to highly distributed systems. With massive scale also comes massive instability, as node and link fail- ures become the norm rather than the exception. For such highly volatile systems, decentralized gossip-based proto- cols are emerging as an approach to maintaining simplicity and scalability while achieving fault-tolerant information dissemination. In this paper, we study the problem of computing aggre- gates with gossip-style protocols. Our first contribution is an analysis of simple gossip-based protocols for the compu- tations of sums, averages, random samples, quantiles, and other aggregate functions, and we show that our protocols converge exponentially fast to the true answer when using uniform gossip. Our second contribution is the definition of a precise no- tion of the speed with which a node’s data diffuses through the network. We show that this diffusion speed is at the heart of the approximation guarantees for all of the above problems. We analyze the diffusion speed of uniform gos- sip in the presence of node and link failures, as well as for flooding-based mechanisms. The latter expose interesting connections to random walks on graphs. 1.},

HTTP/2.0 enables a more efficient use of network resources and a reduced perception of latency by introducing header field compression and allowing multiple concurrent messages on the same connection. It also introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to clients. This document is an alternative to, but does not obsolete, the HTTP/1.1 message syntax. HTTP’s existing semantics remain unchanged. This version of the draft has been marked for implementation. Interoperability testing will occur in the HTTP/2.0 interim in Zurich, CH, starting 2014-01-22. This replaces -08, which was originally identified as an implementation draft.},

They provide client-side interfaces through which users can issue queries and view search results, while at the same time they also accept queries from other servents, check for matches against their local data set, and respond with applicable results. Due to its distributed nature, a network of servents that implements the Gnutella protocol is highly fault-tolerant, as operation of the network will not be interrupted if a subset of servents goes offline.},
