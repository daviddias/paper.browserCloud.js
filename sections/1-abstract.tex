Grid Computing fundamental basis is to use idle resources in  order to maximize their efficiency. This approach quickly grew into non Grid environments, leveraging volunteered shared resources and giving the birth of Public Computing. Today, we face the challenge of how to create a simple and effective way for people to participate in such community efforts and even more importantly, how to enable developers and researchers to use and provide these resources for their applications. This paper explores and proposes a novel way to enable end user machines to communicate using bleeding edge P2P Web technologies such as WebRTC.
