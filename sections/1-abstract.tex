Grid Computing fundamental basis is to use idle resources in  order to maximize their efficiency. This approach quickly grew into non Grid environments, leveraging volunteered shared resources, giving the birth of Public Computing. Today, we face the challenge of how to create a simple and effective way for people to participate in such community efforts and even more importantly, how to reduce the friction of adoption by the developers and researchers to use and provide these resources for their applications. This thesis explores and proposes novel ways to enable end user machines to communicate, using recent Web technologies such as WebRTC.
